# Spanish-learning-Game

This is a game for learning and practicing basic spanish words.

In the first two levels you get a picture and you have to answer what's on that picture
(in the first level there are three possible answer buttons; in the second level you have to write yourself the answer.)
The third level is to show what you have learned in the first two:
you have to write as many words as you remember from the first two levels.
